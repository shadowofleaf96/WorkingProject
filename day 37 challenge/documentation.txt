this is a project which i changed its structure to fit the MVC Profile, i change it like this:

1- our database (array) is moved to models/user.js

2- our controllers, so for login register and logout, i used them in authcontroller.js, for registeration is use registerController. 

3- profile(dashboard) i used profileController.js that has the ability to edit username and password

4- for The views , every task(login...) has an ejs design file in Views folder

diffucultes everywhere but i overcomes them all
