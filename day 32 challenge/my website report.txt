this is the security vulnerabilities that i found and i will try to fix them

1 - Input validation and sanitization (xss) 
   
	* solution : validate and sanitize user input using express-validator

2 - hardcoded password and username 

	* use user-specific salted and hashed passwords

3 - CSRF Protection

	* implement CSRF

4 - Session Management  

	* use express-session

5 - this we did not saw in lms but it is good (Rate limit for login attempts)
	
	* use express-rate-limit
