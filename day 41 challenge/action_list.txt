thats is the list of tasks that need to be taken to improve "Product Management API" to repect RESTful API conventions:

1 - Error messages are not descreptive : the code return simple error message that can be lacking, we can improve those message to 
provide more details about the error

2 - Handling ETag for Caching : ETags are used for cache validation. If you want to enable ETag-based caching, 
you can use the etag middleware in Express, This code generates an ETag for each product and compares it with the client's ETag to determine whether to 
serve the cached version or the updated version.

3 - use HTTPS instead o HTTP : HTTP consider Insecure, need to implement HTTPS for more security for your server
